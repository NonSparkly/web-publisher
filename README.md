# Superdesk Web Publisher

**Superdesk Publisher - the next generation publishing platform for journalists and newsrooms.**

*The Superdesk Publisher is an API-centric delivery tool for digital platforms. Written from scratch in 2016, it builds on top of the knowledge gained from 16 years of delivering digital news at scale with [Newscoop][2]. The Publisher is designed to extend our newsroom management system [Superdesk][3], providing complete, end to end digital publishing solution. Therefore, it allows independent development and maintenance of the editorial systems.*
